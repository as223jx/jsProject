##Introduction
My name is Daniel and I'm 21 years old and comes from Kalmar. 
I started to write some html code on my free time when I was in ninth grade.
In senior high school I went a web course with all the basic of html and css.
On the university I did a website in a project there we used html, css, javascript and asp.net.
I have also had a PHP course.

My hopes on this course is to learn more and become better at Javascript.

My IDE for web programming is Netbeans.
