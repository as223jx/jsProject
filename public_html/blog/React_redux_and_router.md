## React, Redux and React router

### Collect information

The first thing I did was to look at the recommended videos on the school page about React, Redux and React router.
It gave an overall look about what it and what the pro's in using it is.
Though it was not enough to learn how to use it so I had to check on the code in the demo application
and online tutorials.

### Hello world

The next step was to get a basic react program to work. I tried to follow different tutorials
but it took a few attempts to really understand what I was doing and get a working application
and print "hello world" through the React Dom.

### First impression

This seems to be hard tools to get started with and if you don't have earlier programming
experience this is not an easy way to start with.
When you get the hang on it, it can be good and it have some nice functions like the automatic update.
It's a clear structure with react classes with attributes and different functions for each task, e.g. render.
